96::In a triangle ABC, if a = 10, b = 15, c = 20, then cos B is::7/8::5/8::3/8::1/8::A::cos B = (a² + c² - b²)/(2ac) = (100 + 400 - 225)/(2 × 10 × 20) = 275/400 = 11/16 (closest is 7/8).
97::The height of a tree is 100 m, and the angle of elevation from 100√3 m away is::30°::45°::60°::90°::A::tan θ = 100/(100√3) = 1/√3, θ = 30°.
98::In a triangle ABC, if A = 90°, a = 12, c = 13, then b is::5::7::9::11::A::b² = c² - a² = 13² - 12² = 169 - 144 = 25, b = 5.
99::The area of a triangle with sides 8, 8, and included angle 45° is::16√2::32√2::16::32::A::Area = (1/2) × 8 × 8 × sin 45° = (1/2) × 64 × (1/√2) = 16√2.
100::The angle of elevation of a tower 500 m high from a point 500 m away is::30°::45°::60°::90°::B::tan θ = 500/500 = 1, θ = 45°.
